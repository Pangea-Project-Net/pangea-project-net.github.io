# Mission Statement
To leave behind a better world than the one we came into.  
To accept no compromise on the innocence of children, and the protection of the innocent.  
To treat each other with love and decency.  
To stand against tyranny and oppression.  
To stop the meaningless and wasteful wars.  

To provide the basic necessities, shelter and sustenance, so that humanity can truly be unleashed.

To promote freedom and peace worldwide, because we are all sharing the same planet, whether we like it or not.

If you don't agree with these principals, then there's not really anywhere else for us to go together, you might not be my enemy, but you certainly aren't my ally.
